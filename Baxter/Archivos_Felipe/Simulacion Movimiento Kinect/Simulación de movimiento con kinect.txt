Hi guys,
I think I've found a Method that will work as an Installation of the hydro-openni_tracker under ROS-Indigo. Here is a full instruction of what I've done using Ubuntu 14.04 64Bit:

First we have to install some peripheral Libraries:
_OpenNI_
I don't know if all of the following components really have to be installed, but I found this part of the Manual in another forum:

sudo apt-get install git-core cmake freeglut3-dev pkg-config build-essential libxmu-dev libxi-dev  libusb-1.0-0-dev openjdk-6-jdk
doxygen graphviz mono-complete
Now it is possible to download the OpenNI-Package

mkdir ~/kinect
cd ~/kinect
git clone https://github.com/OpenNI/OpenNI.git
We're using the Redist-System for compiling the package:

cd OpenNI/Platform/Linux/CreateRedist/
chmod +x RedistMaker
./RedistMaker
Next step is the Installation of OpenNI:

cd Final
tar -xjf OpenNI-Bin-Dev-Linux-x64-v1.5.7.10.tar.bz2
cd OpenNI-Bin-Dev-Linux-x64-v1.5.7.10
sudo ./install.sh
_SesorKinect_
The way to get this part to work is similar to the OpenNI guide:
Download Package:

cd ~kinect/
git clone git://github.com/ph4m/SensorKinect.git
Compile Package with Redit:

cd SensorKinect/Platform/Linux/CreateRedist/
chmod +x RedistMaker
./RedistMaker
And finally Installation:

cd Final
tar -xjf Sensor-Bin-Linux-x64-v5.1.2.1.tar.bz2
cd Sensor-Bin-Linux-x64-v5.1.2.1
sudo ./install.sh
_NITE_
You can download this Library for example from the link mentioned in the post above. Don't forget that only the Versions NITE v1.5.2.21 and NITE v1.5.2.23 will work for you. Paste the nite-folder into your kinect-folder to keep track of your data:

cd ~kinect/nite/
tar -xjf NITE-Bin-Dev-Linux-x64-v1.5.2.23.tar.bz2
cd NITE-Bin-Dev-Linux-x64-v1.5.2.23
sudo ./install.sh
Now that everything around ROS is installed, we should reboot the system:

sudo reboot
_ROS-Components_
After we have installed all peripheral Libraries, we can install the required ros-core-components for OpenNI-usage. But we have to delete one library before that because of some issues that will appear otherwise:

sudo apt-get remove libopenni-sensor-pointclouds0
Next Step is the Installation of the ROS-Kinect-driver:

sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-openni-launch
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-openni-camera
Finally we can install the openni_tracker to our usually workspace (for example the catkin_ws):

cd ~catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/openni_tracker.git 
cd ..
catkin_make
